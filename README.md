# Student Performance Indicator -  MAchine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting student performance indicators using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The dataset includes various features related to students' demographic information, study habits, and academic performance.

## Features

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding the dataset.

2. Model Building:
- Implementing machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree) for predicting performance indicators.

3. Evaluation:
- Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Visualization:
- Utilizing data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset and model predictions.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing key characteristics of the dataset.

3. Model Building: Implementing and training machine learning models.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using various metrics.

5. Visualization: Creating visualizations to interpret model predictions and dataset features.
